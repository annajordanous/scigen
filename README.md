This is the source code for
[SCIgen](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen).  Detailed instructions on
dependencies and running the code still need to be written.

Running the code. We've been getting a lot of questions about how to run the code. There are quite a few misleading files in the source -- sorry about that. All you need to do to generate a paper is to run make-latex.pl (also look at make-latex.pl --help). You can also use scigen.pl to generate any arbitrary starting target. See scirules.in for most of the grammar rules.
